# v0.0.4h Implementation Plan: Home Navigation & Metrics Default Range

## Overview

This version focuses on improving navigation and user experience defaults:

1.  **Home Page Navigation:** Add links on the main landing page (`/`) to provide easy access to all key sections of the application (Initiatives, Metrics, Capacity, Roadmap).
2.  **Metrics Default Date Range:** Change the default time period displayed in the Metrics section (`/metrics`) for the Table, Chart, and Forecast views to '1 Year' ('1Y') instead of the previous default.

## Prerequisites

-   Access to the application development environment (Replit).
-   Access to the codebase.

## Test Environment

-   Browser: Chrome latest version (or any modern browser)
-   User Accounts: Standard authenticated user access is sufficient. No specific multi-user testing required for these changes.

## Database Updates

-   None required for this version.

## Component & Configuration Updates

1.  **Home Page (`pages/index.tsx`)**
    *   **Action:** Modify the main content of the home page.
    *   **Details:** Add navigation links (using Next.js `<Link>` component) pointing to the following pages:
        *   `/initiatives` (Initiatives)
        *   `/metrics` (Metrics)
        *   `/capacity` (Capacity)
        *   `/roadmap` (Roadmap)
    *   Apply basic styling to make the links clear and accessible.

2.  **Metrics Page (`pages/metrics/index.tsx`)**
    *   **Action:** Update the state initialization for the date range selection.
    *   **Details:** Locate the `useState` hook managing the selected date range. Change the initial default value from its current setting (e.g., '6M' or 'All') to `'1Y'`.
    *   **Verification:** Ensure this default applies consistently across the "Table", "Chart", and "Forecast" views within the metrics page, affecting the initial data fetch and the default selection in any date range control components (like `DateRangeSelector.tsx`, `ChartControls.tsx`, or `ForecastControls.tsx` if they derive their default from this state).

3.  **Date Range Components (e.g., `components/metrics/DateRangeSelector.tsx`)** (If Applicable)
    *   **Action:** Review components responsible for rendering the date range selection UI.
    *   **Details:** Ensure these components correctly reflect the default '1Y' state passed down from `pages/metrics/index.tsx` on initial load. No changes should be needed if they correctly use the state/props provided.

## Success Criteria

1.  The home page (`/`) displays clear navigation links to Initiatives, Metrics, Capacity, and Roadmap.
2.  Clicking each link on the home page successfully navigates the user to the corresponding section.
3.  When navigating to the Metrics page (`/metrics`), the date range selector component defaults to showing '1 Year' ('1Y') as the selected period.
4.  The data initially displayed in the Metrics Table, Metrics Chart, and Metrics Forecast views corresponds to the last 1 year by default.
5.  Changing the date range selector manually still functions correctly after the default change.

## Notes on Scope & Approach

*   Focuses solely on UI updates for navigation and default settings.
*   Does not involve changes to data fetching logic beyond the initial date range parameters.
*   Assumes standard Next.js routing and React state management patterns are used.

## Manual Testing Steps

### 1. Home Page Navigation Verification
-   **Test 1.1:** Load Home Page
    -   **Action:** Navigate to the application's root URL (`/`).
    -   **Expected Result:** The page loads, displaying navigation links labelled "Initiatives", "Metrics", "Capacity", and "Roadmap" (or similar appropriate text).
    -   **Status:** TBD
-   **Test 1.2:** Link Functionality
    -   **Action:** Click on the "Initiatives" link.
    -   **Expected Result:** The browser navigates to the `/initiatives` page.
    -   **Status:** TBD
-   **Test 1.3:** Link Functionality
    -   **Action:** Navigate back to `/`. Click on the "Metrics" link.
    -   **Expected Result:** The browser navigates to the `/metrics` page.
    -   **Status:** TBD
-   **Test 1.4:** Link Functionality
    -   **Action:** Navigate back to `/`. Click on the "Capacity" link.
    -   **Expected Result:** The browser navigates to the `/capacity` page.
    -   **Status:** TBD
-   **Test 1.5:** Link Functionality
    -   **Action:** Navigate back to `/`. Click on the "Roadmap" link.
    -   **Expected Result:** The browser navigates to the `/roadmap` page.
    -   **Status:** TBD

### 2. Metrics Default Date Range Verification
-   **Test 2.1:** Initial Load Default Selection
    -   **Action:** Navigate directly to the `/metrics` page (or via the home page link).
    -   **Expected Result:** The date range selection UI element (e.g., dropdown, button group) shows '1 Year' (or '1Y') as the currently selected option upon initial page load.
    -   **Status:** TBD
-   **Test 2.2:** Initial Load Data Display (Table View)
    -   **Action:** Ensure the "Table" view is selected (if applicable). Observe the data displayed in the metric tables.
    -   **Expected Result:** The tables show data points primarily from the last 12 months (relative to the current date or latest data point). Verify the date range of the displayed data.
    -   **Status:** TBD
-   **Test 2.3:** Initial Load Data Display (Chart View)
    -   **Action:** Switch to the "Chart" view. Observe the metric charts.
    -   **Expected Result:** The charts display data points primarily from the last 12 months. Verify the date range shown on the X-axis.
    -   **Status:** TBD
-   **Test 2.4:** Initial Load Data Display (Forecast View)
    -   **Action:** Switch to the "Forecast" view. Observe the forecast charts.
    -   **Expected Result:** The forecast view bases its projection on historical data, and the default view should reflect the '1 Year' setting (though the forecast itself might project further out). Verify the historical portion shown aligns with the 1-year default.
    -   **Status:** TBD
-   **Test 2.5:** Manual Selection Change
    -   **Action:** Manually select a different date range (e.g., '6M' or 'All').
    -   **Expected Result:** The selected range becomes active, and the Table, Chart, and Forecast views update to reflect the newly selected date range. This confirms that changing the default didn't break manual selection.
    -   **Status:** TBD

### 3. Regression Checks
-   **Test 3.1:** Other Page Functionality
    -   **Action:** Briefly navigate to and interact with `/initiatives`, `/capacity`, and `/roadmap`.
    -   **Expected Result:** Existing functionality on these pages remains unaffected by the changes made for v0.0.4h.
    -   **Status:** TBD
-   **Test 3.2:** Authentication/Layout
    -   **Action:** Log out and log back in (if applicable). Check the main application layout.
    -   **Expected Result:** Authentication and the overall page structure (header, footer, etc.) remain consistent.
    -   **Status:** TBD
