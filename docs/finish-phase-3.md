# Completing Phase 3: Forecasting Engine & Data Infrastructure

## Current Focus (Visualization Phase - v0.0.3e)
We have completed the basic metrics functionality in v0.0.3d:
✅ MetricInput component working correctly
✅ Metrics page data loading and display
✅ Date handling between frontend and Supabase
✅ Error handling and form validation
✅ Tabbed interface for metric organization

Next focus for v0.0.3e: Implementing metric visualization
- Create MetricChart component using Recharts
- Show historical data in line chart format
- Add interactive features (tooltips, legends)
- Implement date range selection

## Current Status (v0.0.3d)
✅ Completed:
- Basic authentication with Supabase
- User profile management
- Database schema setup
- Data persistence layer
- Basic metrics infrastructure:
  - Database schema for historical_metrics
  - MetricInput component for data entry
  - Tabbed metrics page with type-specific views
  - RLS policies for data security
  - Proper date and timezone handling
  - Financial data validation

❌ Missing:
1. Historical Metrics Features
   - ✅ Upload/input interface
   - ✅ Storage and retrieval
   - ✅ Type-specific organization
   - ✅ Metric visualization (charts)
   - ❌ Forecast integration

2. Forecasting Engine
   - ✅ Baseline metric visualization
   - ❌ Forecast calculation logic
   - ❌ Uplift visualization against baseline

3. Business Metrics Tracking
   - ✅ Conversion rate tracking
   - ✅ Loan size tracking
   - ✅ Interest rate tracking
   - ✅ Metric history views with charts
   - ❌ Trend analysis

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Database Work
✅ Completed:
- Add indexes for metric queries
- Set up metric type validation

❌ Still Needed:
- Implement metric aggregation functions

### 2. Data Access Layer
✅ Completed:
- Basic Supabase integration for metrics
- Direct database access setup
- Type-safe query handling

❌ Still Needed:
- Implement forecast calculations
- Add metric aggregation support
- Enhanced filtering and retrieval

### 3. Frontend Components
✅ Completed:
- Historical metric input form
- Basic metric management interface
- Tabbed metric type organization
- Metric visualization charts

❌ Still Needed:
- Forecast display components
- Enhanced metric management interface

### 4. Integration
❌ Still Needed:
- Connect forecast display to initiatives
- Link metric history to forecasts
- Implement real-time metric updates

## Revised Implementation Order

1. **Metric Visualization (v0.0.3e - ✅ Completed)**
   - Create MetricChart component using Recharts
   - Implement proper date handling per fix-date.md
   - Add type selection and date range controls
   - Add interactive tooltips and legends

2. **Forecasting Foundation (v0.0.3f - Next Focus)**
   - Create ForecastDisplay component
   - Implement basic forecast calculations
   - Add initiative impact visualization

3. **Data Layer Enhancements**
   - Add metric aggregation functions
   - Implement forecast calculations
   - Enhanced filtering and retrieval

4. **Integration and Polish**
   - Connect forecasts to initiatives
   - Add real-time updates
   - Enhance UI/UX

## One-Shot Prompt

```
Implement the forecasting engine and historical metrics tracking for RoadmapAI Phase 3. This should include:

1. Create components/metrics/MetricInput.tsx:
- Form for inputting historical metrics (conversion, loan size, interest rate)
- Date selection
- Validation
- Supabase integration

2. Create components/metrics/MetricChart.tsx:
- Line chart showing historical metrics
- Forecast overlay
- Interactive tooltips
- Legend and controls

3. Create components/forecasting/ForecastDisplay.tsx:
- Combined view of baseline and projected metrics
- Initiative impact visualization
- Cumulative uplift calculation
- Date range controls

4. Create utils/forecasting.ts:
- Forecast calculation utilities
- Metric aggregation helpers
- Date handling functions
- Data validation

5. Create pages/metrics/index.tsx:
- Metric management dashboard
- Upload interface
- Historical view
- Forecast view

6. Update schema.sql:
- Add indexes for metric queries
- Add metric aggregation functions
- Add metric validation constraints

7. Add utility functions in utils/metrics.ts:
- Forecast calculation
- Metric aggregation
- Date handling
- Data validation

Use:
- Recharts for visualizations
- Supabase for data storage
- React Query for data fetching
- Date-fns for date handling
- Zod for validation

Follow existing patterns:
- TailwindCSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
- React hooks for state
- Direct Supabase queries
```

## Success Criteria
- Historical metrics can be uploaded and viewed
- Forecasts are calculated and displayed
- Business metrics are tracked and visualized
- Data is properly persisted in Supabase
- UI is consistent with existing design
- All features are properly typed and validated

## Next Steps After Completion
1. Test with sample historical data
2. Verify forecast calculations
3. Document metric upload format
4. Create user guide for metric management
5. Plan transition to Phase 4
